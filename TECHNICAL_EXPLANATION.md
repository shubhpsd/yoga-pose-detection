## üî¨ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **1. DATA PREPROCESSING (pose_extractor.py)**

#### **MediaPipe Pose Estimation:**
```python
# Initialize MediaPipe pose detection
self.mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
self.pose = self.mp_pose.Pose(
    static_image_mode=True,     # For static images
    model_complexity=2,         # Highest accuracy model
    enable_segmentation=False,  # We don't need body segmentation
    min_detection_confidence=0.5 # Minimum confidence threshold
)
```

#### **Feature Extraction Process:**
1. **Input**: RGB images of yoga poses
2. **MediaPipe Processing**: Detects 33 key body landmarks
3. **Feature Vector**: Each landmark provides (x, y, z, visibility) = 4 values
4. **Total Features**: 33 landmarks √ó 4 coordinates = **132 features per pose**

#### **Key Body Landmarks:**

)
```
- **Learning Rate Schedule**: Follows cosine curve
- **Warm Restarts**: Periodically resets to high learning rate
- **Benefits**: Escapes local minima, finds better solutions

**4. Feature Normalization:**
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
features_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(features)
```

### **Anticipated Viva Questions**

**Q1: Explain your neural network architecture and why you chose it.**
**A**: Our improved model uses an attention-based architecture with 184K parameters. First, each of the 33 body landmarks (each with 4 coordinates) is processed individually through a landmark processor that maps each 4D input to a 16D intermediate representation. Then, an attention mechanism calculates importance weights for each landmark, emphasizing relevant body parts. The weighted features are flattened and processed through a classifier with batch normalization and dropout for regularization. This architecture is superior to a standard feedforward network because it learns which body parts are most important for each pose classification.

**Q2: How does the pose feature extraction work?**
**A**: We use MediaPipe's pose detection model which locates 33 key body landmarks in each image. For each landmark, we extract x, y, z coordinates and a visibility score (132 total features). The model is pre-trained on large human pose datasets and works across different body types, clothing, and lighting conditions. These landmarks capture the geometric positioning of the body regardless of image background or person-specific features, making them ideal for pose classification.

**Q3: What optimization techniques did you implement and why?**
**A**: We implemented several advanced techniques: (1) AdamW optimizer with weight decay (0.001) to prevent overfitting, (2) Cosine annealing learning rate schedule with warm restarts to escape local minima, (3) Label smoothing (0.1) to prevent overconfident predictions, (4) BatchNorm to stabilize training, (5) Dropout to improve generalization, and (6) Early stopping with patience of 25 epochs. Together, these techniques helped achieve 90%+ accuracy on a challenging 107-class problem.

**Q4: How did you handle the training data split and why?**
**A**: We used a stratified split to ensure proper class representation: 75% training, 15% validation, and 10% test data. Stratification was critical because our dataset has varying numbers of samples per class. The validation set guided hyperparameter tuning and early stopping decisions, while the test set provided the final unbiased evaluation of model performance.

**Q5: Explain your Streamlit deployment strategy and architecture.**
**A**: Our Streamlit application provides an easy-to-use interface for yoga pose detection with two main workflows: image upload and camera capture. The application follows a modular design with the `YogaPoseDetector` class handling model loading, landmark extraction, and pose classification. The UI is organized into tabs with proper error handling and graceful degradation when model files aren't available. We cache the detector instance for performance and implement asynchronous processing with spinners to maintain responsiveness.

**Q6: What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?**
**A**: Key challenges included: (1) Class imbalance in the dataset - addressed through stratified sampling, (2) Overfitting due to model complexity - solved with comprehensive regularization, (3) Model deployment size - resolved by separating feature extraction from classification, (4) Real-time performance - optimized by using lightweight model complexity settings in MediaPipe, and (5) Error handling in the web application - implemented graceful degradation for missing components.

**Q7: How did you evaluate your model performance?**
**A**: We used multiple evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis. We tracked these metrics during training to prevent overfitting and evaluated final performance on the held-out test set. The confusion matrix helped identify commonly confused pose classes, which informed potential model improvements. Our final model achieved over 90% validation accuracy and approximately similar performance on test data.

**Q8: How would you improve this project given more time and resources?**
**A**: Key improvements would include: (1) Data augmentation to increase training samples, (2) Implementing temporal modeling for video pose sequences, (3) Distillation techniques to create smaller, faster models, (4) Exploring transformer architectures for better contextual understanding of poses, (5) Active learning to identify and collect more samples of challenging poses, and (6) Model quantization for improved mobile deployment.

**Q9: Explain your development workflow and testing methodology.**
**A**: We followed an iterative development process: (1) Data collection and preprocessing, (2) Simple baseline model development, (3) Improved model with attention mechanism, (4) Hyperparameter optimization, (5) Final model training with early stopping, (6) Extensive evaluation, and (7) Streamlit application development. We tested continuously, comparing model variations and tracking metrics to ensure performance improvements at each stage.

**Q10: What are the real-world applications of this system?**
**A**: This system can be used for: (1) Personal yoga practice assistance, (2) Remote coaching for yoga instructors, (3) Integration with fitness applications, (4) Form correction for beginners, (5) Yoga research and pose standardization, and (6) Physical therapy monitoring. The lightweight architecture allows deployment on various devices, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
